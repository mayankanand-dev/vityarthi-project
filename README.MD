# 🕹️ Pygame Tetris Clone

A classic **Tetris game** implemented in **Python** using the **Pygame** library.

This project is a functional clone of the popular puzzle game where the player must rotate and move falling geometric shapes (Tetriminos) to create complete horizontal lines, which are then cleared, scoring points.

## ✨ Features

* **Classic Gameplay**: Contains all seven standard Tetriminos (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).
* **Rotations and Movement**: Full control over piece movement (Left, Right, Down) and rotation.
* **Soft Drop**: Pressing 'Down' speeds up the fall rate.
* **Hard Drop**: Pressing 'Space' instantly drops the piece to the bottom.
* **Line Clearing**: Automatically clears completed rows.
* **Scoring**: Simple scoring system based on lines cleared.
* **High Score Tracking**: Stores the highest score in a local `highscore.txt` file.
* **Next Piece Display**: Shows the next piece to fall.
* **Game Over**: Detects when the stack reaches the top.
